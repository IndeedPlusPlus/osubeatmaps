        <h1>What is a beatmap?</h1>

        <p>Also called map for short, they are game levels in osu!, like the stages in the DS games. In their most
            basic
            form, beatmaps have a song and Hit Circles, Sliders, and/or Spinners placed according to the rhythm of
            the
            music, but they can also have a background image or video, or even a Storyboard. Creators of beatmaps
            are
            called beatmappers or mappers for short. Beatmaps are uploaded for everyone to see and play with using
            the
            BSS, and are then modded. If/Once a beatmap is deemed good enough, it is ranked or, if fulfilling
            certain
            criteria, approved.</p>

        <p>On this site there are only ranked beatmaps to download.</p>
